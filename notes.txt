Migration for troles_user
roles.edit styling & users.edit

edit delete completed for roles


fixing route(roles.edit) for padding Zz

Troles create function working well

p(1.0): the error occured from the validation error eg:  'name' => 'required|max:255|unique:users' when
it should be  'name' => 'required|max:255|unique:troles'
