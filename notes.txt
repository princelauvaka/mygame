*Look in to creating your own Facades


======================
Extras:
======================
fixing route(roles.edit) for padding Zz

Troles create function working well

p(1.0): the error occured from the validation error eg:  'name' => 'required|max:255|unique:users' when
it should be  'name' => 'required|max:255|unique:troles'

p(1.0): tried to create role, validation. PROBLEM: Check Naming convention for model and tables (plural y/n)

Some css alignment for error messages
Model, Migration, Controller created for roles
